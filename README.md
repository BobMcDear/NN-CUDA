# Neural network in CUDA/C++
This is an implementation of a neural net, completely from scratch (including basic tensor operations like matrix multiplication), in CUDA/C++. You can find the accompanying blog for the code [here](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/implementing-a-neural-net-in-cuda-from-scratch-part-1-introduction-9cd7f63573a7).
